          <td>The distinction between the "letter of the rule" and the "spirit of the rule" refers to whether an individual interprets and follows a rule strictly based on its precise wording, or instead also considers its underlying intent or larger purpose. The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context.A "letter of the rule" interpretation adheres strictly to the rule's language, often exploiting ambiguities or loopholes to achieve a specific outcome. This approach allows the rule's exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if it benefits the interpreter.A "spirit of the rule" interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule's true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, this approach appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.Example:Imagine a large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn't regulated as a greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.By exploiting the "letter of the rule," the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment and public health in practice.A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their "spirit" or underlying purpose - protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts the regulations' intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.</td>

            For an Alignment Conserver who has been appointed to the Emergency Response Group, the requirements of this role become as critical to the assessment of their overall performance as their customary obligations.The Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are required to document all instances of Emergency Response Group Members' failure to meet emergency-preparedness requirements. Given their domain expertise and proximity to each emergency situation, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead are granted the discretion to evaluate emergency-preparedness deficiencies. Generally, they are required to take swift action to address non-negligible emergency-preparedness deficiencies in the following manner.Where the deficient Member is an Alignment Conserver, that Member should be derecognized pursuant to <a href="https://www.notion.so/A-1-4-Alignment-Conservers-Accountability-And-Misalignment-Handling-Adjudication-Process-45b9378d78b44bffb650d55ca048b814?pvs=21">A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - Adjudication Process</a>.Where the deficient Alignment Conserver is the Support Facilitators, the Protocol Security Workstream Lead and a majority of active Scope Facilitators must reach consensus in order to initiate a derecognition proceeding against the Support Facilitators. Once this threshold is met, the procedure defined in <a href="https://www.notion.so/A-1-4-Alignment-Conservers-Accountability-And-Misalignment-Handling-Adjudication-Process-45b9378d78b44bffb650d55ca048b814?pvs=21">A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - Adjudication Process</a> should be followed. In the interim, other Scope Facilitators must step in temporarily to coordinate emergency response.The initiation of derecognition is done at the discretion of the Support Facilitators (or other Scope Facilitator) and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response Group Members for review.When an Alignment Conserver is removed from the Emergency Response Group and derecognized for deficient performance, the Governance Facilitators must transparently announce this action pursuant to <a href="https://www.notion.so/A-1-4-Alignment-Conservers-Accountability-And-Misalignment-Handling-Derecognition-Notice-cd30a7ca05a444cd83062512e16d4d1d?pvs=21">A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - Derecognition Notice</a>.The Support Facilitators have the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the Alignment Conserver's derecognition and removal should be retained internally or publicly shared on the Forum (with redactions, if needed).

The Governance Facilitators must ensure that use of the Multisig is generally aligned and specifically accords with the requirements defined herein.</td>

            Sky Protocol uses circuit-breakers to mitigate undesired scenarios, which circuit-breakers are called MOM contracts. MOM contracts must first be triggered through a spell, after which they bypass the GSM Pause Delay and can immediately act on the Protocol. See <a href="https://www.notion.so/A-1-9-Sky-Core-Governance-Security-Governance-Security-Delay-Requirements-Exceptions-af80bd3b115a4f7e9b05fc1fbeed352c?pvs=21">A.1.9 - Sky Core Governance Security - Governance Security Delay Requirements - Exceptions</a>.In emergency scenarios, time is a scarce resource. Therefore, Standby Spells are used in validated emergency scenarios to trigger a MOM contract. In an emergency situation, spell teams can then focus on crafting an ad hoc Emergency Spell to solve the root cause of an issue, if appropriate. Due to Standby Spells, it is no longer necessary in an emergency for spell teams to spend time crafting and reviewing a spell whose sole purpose is to trigger a mitigation of the issue, i.e., the MOM contract.Standby Spells open new attack vectors that must be mitigated pursuant to <a href="https://www.notion.so/A-1-9-Sky-Core-Governance-Security-Emergency-Spells-ADs-Role-In-Standby-Spells-151f2ff08d7380b1b7f1e4819772f8ca?pvs=21">A.1.9 - Sky Core Governance Security - Emergency Spells - ADs' Role In Standby Spells</a>.

Polls often run concurrently, allowing voters to participate in any number of them at the same time. Polls may have different formats like Binary Voting, Instant Run-Off Voting, or Approval Voting depending on the topic.

          <td>An Executive Vote (also "Executive") is a formalized governance proposal that requires on-chain voting. Through the Executive Vote mechanism, SKY holders steward Sky Governance by voting on Executive proposals that pertain to operations maintaining the Protocol. Executive Votes execute technical changes to the Sky Protocol.The Executive Vote occurs approximately every two weeks. Its contents are often determined by weekly Governance Polls that pre-approve the inclusion of proposals in the Executive Vote. However, the Atlas can explicitly authorize proposals to go directly to an Executive Vote.Note that the terms 'Executive' and 'spell' are distinct concepts. The term 'Executive' or 'Executive Vote' is used in all instances where the formal governance vote is being referenced. The term 'Executive Process' refers to the end-to-end process of the development of an Executive Vote, in which Facilitators, spell teams (also referred to collectively as the "Governance Security Engineering Team") and other recognized Ecosystem Actors participate. The term 'spell' refers to the smart contract that executes the changes to the protocol approved by Sky Governance in an Executive Vote. Generally, when referring to spell team operations and their technical outcome or product (including code base, code operations, code reviews and code quality), the term 'spell' will be used. The term 'spell process' refers to the end-to-end process of developing a spell, a process in which the Governance Facilitators and the current spell team participate. The term 'spell development process' is a subset of the 'spell process' and pertains solely to the technical development of the spell by the current spell team.</td>

Where more than one Prime Delegate posts an intention to trigger a Weekly Cycle Proposal, the first Prime Delegate to post a reply to the Author's Forum post shall be treated as the triggering Prime Delegate.If the Weekly Cycle Proposal is subsequently voted down, the triggering Prime Delegate loses their entire AD Buffer.

In the event there are more than two conflicting Atlas Edit Weekly Cycle Proposals, the Governance Facilitators may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.A Reconciliation Process Poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the originating polls.

Any action taken by the Governance Facilitators in this regard will be documented publicly and should be available for examination prior to the end date of the relevant ratification polls.Where simultaneous edits are conflicting / logically incompatible and cannot be coherently reconciled: it falls to voters to decide which of the conflicting AEPs they wish to accept. If there are two conflicting AEPs, a subsequent binary vote is appropriate in the form of a Reconciliation Process Poll. In the event there are more than two conflicting AEPs, the Governance Facilitators may choose a suitable polling method that allows voters to choose between multiple options. The difference between the conflicting amendments must be clearly presented so that voters can make an informed choice on their preferred option.A Reconciliation Process poll will take place during the Operational Weekly Cycle immediately following the closure of the ratification polls.

            A Star Agent that has a Globally Active Primitive may freely create (assuming the Primitive was properly Invoked), suspend, archive, or update individual instances of that Primitive, subject to the rules defined in the Agent Artifact and the Sky Core Atlas. For example, the Agent may run multiple Integration Boost instances in parallel (each with its own markets and configurations), toggling them on or off as needed, without affecting the underlying Integration Boost Primitive's Global Activation Status. Changing a Primitive's Instance-Level Status can be effected through the governance process defined in the Root Edit Primitive, or through an appropriately configured Omni Document.

The API endpoint is <a href="https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/">https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/</a> for Integration Boost Partners on Ethereum and <a href="https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/">https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/</a> on Solana. In the long term, Operational GovOps assumes responsibility for ensuring that the data submission meets the on-chain verifiability requirement; this is done as part of their review of Invocations of the Integration Boost Primitive.

The payment must be calculated manually at the end of each quarter by the Spark Star Facilitators and manually paid as Dai to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance from the Spark Star Surplus Buffer. The payments must occur for the revenue share duration of two (2) years, starting from the moment this amendment is approved by Sky Governance. If at any point in time after the launch of Star tokens, Spark Protocol is generating less than 1 million Dai per year in income for Spark Star, accrual towards the revenue share payments are paused (unpaid revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when Spark Protocol is generating more than 1 million Dai per year in income again.Before the launch of Star tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a "virtual revenue share" on behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark Protocol, and then assuming a "virtual income" equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. As an example: if, before the launch of Star tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai. This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Star tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol.Once Star tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect.</td>

          <td>The element, "clearly delineated processes and frameworks," highlights a central issue in interpreting the Atlas. All language must be interpreted to be understood. In this sense, eliminating subjectivity is an unattainable goal. (Even an artificial intelligence system which eliminates many steps of research for the user will still serve up information that must be first interpreted by the user before it can be effective.) Inference or extrapolation is necessarily inherent in interpretation, and comes in degrees. In the context of the Target Document, the element, "clearly delineated processes and frameworks," affirms that an interpreter's extraction of rules/principles/processes should be maximally grounded in the explicit language of the Immutable Documents.</td>

            The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act that is not mild. The Target Document is also silent on the subject of the proper remedial approach if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.Despite the lack of explicit guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in <a href="https://www.notion.so/A-1-4-4bff69634ac6453ea7bd00864b321092?pvs=21">A.1.4</a> to reach a reliable adjudication principle. Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk. The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an opportunity for corrective action and learning. After the initial warning, any subsequent breach must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal Alignment.

            The Target Document is violated if an Alignment Conserver formally occupies two or more Sky ecosystem roles. The phrase "other ecosystem roles" is read in its broadest sense to mean the totality of roles that are formally defined in the Atlas with a function in the Sky ecosystem. Such "ecosystem roles" include, but are not limited to, Alignment Conserver, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Active or Incubating Ecosystem Actor, Agent Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors.

Assuming that the Proposal is approved, the Governance Facilitators are authorized to disburse the entire contents of the AD Buffer to the triggering AD in the next AD compensation cycle.

            This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc. The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence? What types of evidence are permissible to consider? See <a href="https://www.notion.so/Responsibly-Provided-Whistleblower-Evidence-Of-Misalignment-Must-Be-Secured-Ethically-1aebce58d3164be29d0f2f3d618996e5?pvs=21">Responsibly Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically</a>. What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element "the highest standard of Universal Alignment"? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

          <td>This is an extensive Research Track. Some critical questions to be explored:What criteria should be used to determine when two or more Atlas Edit Proposals are in conflict? Are conflicts strictly based on overlapping content, or do broader thematic or operational conflicts also count?For instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to contradictory outcomes, how should the Governance Facilitators identify and address this indirect conflict?What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP should take precedence?If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?If merging proposals in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the governance process due to the perception that decisions are never final. The continuous cycle of evaluating, merging, and discarding parts of conflicting AEPs is not only time-consuming but also increases the complexity of governance operations.If the Governance Facilitators merge parts of two approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters' will becomes a compelling question.</td>

            This need is an extensive Research Track. The central research need that grows out of the Facilitator role has to do with developing systematic principles and protocols to serve as the foundation for adjudicating disputes and controversies, including processes for fact-finding, evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals process, etc. The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing, such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. Needed Research here includes methods for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence? What types of evidence are permissible to consider? See <a href="https://www.notion.so/Responsibly-Provided-Whistleblower-Evidence-Of-Misalignment-Must-Be-Secured-Ethically-1aebce58d3164be29d0f2f3d618996e5?pvs=21">Responsibly Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically</a>. What are the processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? Then there is the matter of assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. How much discretion should Facilitators have in interpreting and applying the element "the highest standard of Universal Alignment"? How to safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs), the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in decision-making.

(This could fall under the Governance Scope and its requirement for Governance Security processes.) Their task would be to thoroughly analyze the security needs and risks of the Alignment Conservers and develop ever-evolving Operational Security "Best Practices."With an explicit framework of agreed-upon Best Practices, all anon Alignment Conservers have a known target to meet. Further, the existence of an objective framework of Best Practices equips the Governance Facilitators to easily determine when a breach of opsec best practice has occurred. The explicit framework removes the risk of the Facilitators inappropriately inserting subjective bias into the decisionmaking process.The Security Scope Advisor could also assist in reviewing an informant's evidence to evaluate its validity/quality. The Security Scope Advisor could ensure that the methods used by the informant to secure the evidence were ethical. (All communications, evidence and data shared with the Security Scope Advisor would be under confidentiality protection). Finally, such an Advisor would have specialized expertise in opsec and associated matters that Governance Facilitators lack."This Needed Research is an extensive Research Track, given the wide-ranging implications and potential mechanisms around opsec best practices, and also how these should map onto the Atlas.

              Before the launch of Agent tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a "virtual revenue share" on behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark Protocol, and then assuming a "virtual income" equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter.As an example: if, before the launch of Agent tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai.This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Agent tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol.Once SPK tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect.
